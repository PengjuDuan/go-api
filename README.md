Go API is a pluggable API framework driven by service discovery to help build powerful public API gateways.

## Overview

The Go API library provides api gateway routing capabilities. A microservice architecture decouples application logic into 
separate service. An api gateway provides a single entry point to consolidate these services into a unified api.

Go API is the basis for the micro api.
